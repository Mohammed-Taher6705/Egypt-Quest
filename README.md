# Egypt Quest

A map adventure across Egypt — every place on the map opens a different mini-game.
Runs as a **web app (PWA)** and as an **Android app** (Capacitor), from the same code in `www/`.

## Project layout

```
www/                         ← the whole web app (also Capacitor's webDir)
  index.html                 ← entry point (script order matters, see below)
  css/style.css
  js/
    config.js                ← VERSION, place order, ADS settings  ← edit here
    map.js                   ← the Egypt map: outline, Nile, labels, markers, golden scarabs, gestures
    map-art.js               ← illustrated map BACKGROUND (code-painted terrain, seas, relief) — no text/markers
    world.js                 ← hidden-object world engine (used by Giza)
    ads.js                   ← ad layer: AdMob (Android) / H5 Games Ads (web) / test mock
    app.js                   ← Android back button, splash, service worker, external links
    main.js                  ← boot + render loop (loaded last)
    core/
      registry.js            ← definePlace() / defineBonus() → builds SITES, WORLDS, GAMES…
      progression.js         ← Ankh tokens, level/place unlock rules, trials, save migration (pure, unit-tested)
      state.js  i18n.js  canvas.js  audio.js  save.js  fx.js
      progress.js            ← levels, stars, intro, win/result dialog

      qgen.js                ← live question generator (Wikidata + Open Trivia DB) + quiz renderer
  games/                     ← ONE FILE PER PLACE (map pin + info + game)
    grand-egyptian-museum.js  giza-pyramids.js  alexandria-qaitbay.js  luxor-karnak.js
    aswan-philae.js  abu-simbel.js  siwa-oasis.js  edfu-temple.js  saint-catherine-sinai.js

    kharga-oasis.js  el-gouna.js
    bonus/  scarab-rush.js  pharaoh-quiz.js  treasure-catch.js
  assets/images/  assets/icons/
  manifest.webmanifest  sw.js
android/                     ← generated Capacitor Android project (committed)
resources/                   ← source art for Android icons/splash
capacitor.config.json  package.json
```

All scripts are plain `<script>` tags sharing one global scope (no bundler).
Order in `index.html`: `config → core → map/world → ads/app → games → bonus → main`.

### Adding a new place

1. Create `www/games/my-place.js`:
   ```js
   definePlace({
     id:"myplace", lon:31.2, lat:30.0,
     en:"My Place", ar:"…", eraEn:"…", eraAr:"…", dEn:"…", dAr:"…",
     logo:"assets/images/myplace.jpg",        // optional, else icon(ctx) is drawn
     challenge:["My challenge","…"], par:45, starTip:["…","…"],
     levels:(x,k)=>L2((5+x)+" items",(5+x)+" عناصر"),  // text in the level list
     fact:["…","…"],
     icon(ctx){ /* draw a ~20px glyph centred on 0,0 */ },
     game:(()=>({ help:{en:"…",ar:"…"}, start(){}, status(){return""}, draw(t){}, tap(x,y){ /* winGame(1..3) */ } }))()
   });
   ```
2. Add `<script src="games/my-place.js"></script>` in `index.html`.
3. Add `"myplace"` to `SITE_ORDER` in `js/config.js` (position = unlock order).
   Optional: `unlock:{levels:2,stars:4}` in `definePlace` changes what the previous place needs to open this one.

Use `later(fn, ms)` instead of `setTimeout` inside games — it is cancelled automatically when the run ends.

## The map scene (v4.2)

The map is drawn in two layers every frame:

| Layer | File | What it contains |
|---|---|---|
| Background | `www/js/map-art.js` (`MapArt`) | seas with depth and reef shelves, neighbouring lands fading into the navy theme, sand texture, shaded relief (Red Sea Hills, Sinai, Gilf Kebir, dunes, oasis depressions, the Nile valley), oases, the Nile, Delta, Lake Nasser, Suez Canal, gold coastline & graticule, night-time city lights |
| Interactive | `www/js/map.js` | labels (EN/AR), markers & destination images, stars, daily badge, golden/cursed scarab, boats, camels, compass, all gestures and hit-testing |

- The background is **painted by code in longitude/latitude** with the same projection as `mp()` — it never contains text, markers, icons or UI.
- It is cached at device resolution: moved/scaled during a pinch or drag, re-painted crisp ~140 ms after the gesture ends.
- The relief is computed once (in ≤12 ms slices, so the game never freezes) and cached on the device in IndexedDB.
- Palettes per map theme (Classic / Sunset / Night) are at the top of `map-art.js` (`PAL`).
- Export a clean artwork image (no UI), e.g. for store screenshots, from the browser console:
  `MapArt.renderImage(2560,1707).toBlob(b=>open(URL.createObjectURL(b)))`

Backup of the previous map: `backup/map-v4.1/` (also git tag `map-v4.1-backup`).

## Run locally

```bash
npm start            # serves www/ on http://localhost:8080
```
Deep links: `index.html?game=giza`, `index.html?bonus=quiz` (locked places only get selected).

## Ads

Configured in `www/js/config.js → ADS`. Placement rules (policy-friendly):

| Type | Where | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Banner | Map screen only | hidden during any game |
| Interstitial | When leaving a result dialog | every 3 finishes, ≥120 s apart, none in first 180 s |
| Rewarded | "Double points" on result, "+3 hints" when out / in shop, "Open chest now" | always opt-in |

Timers are compensated during rewarded ads, audio pauses during ads.

**Android (AdMob)** — `@capacitor-community/admob`
1. Create the app + 3 ad units (banner, interstitial, rewarded) in AdMob.
2. Put the ids in `ADS.native` and the **app id** in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (`com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID` — currently Google's test id).
3. Set `ADS.test=false` for release. Consent (UMP/GDPR) is requested automatically on start; create the consent message in AdMob → Privacy & messaging.
4. Add `app-ads.txt` to your website.

**Web (Google H5 Games Ads / AdSense)**
1. Apply for AdSense with H5 games ads; set `ADS.web.client = "ca-pub-…"` (and optionally `bannerSlot`).
2. With `test:true` the H5 test mode is used. With no `client` set and `test:true`, a local **mock** ad is shown so you can check layouts.

If you target kids, set `ADS.childDirected=true` (Google Families policy).

## Web deploy

Upload the `www/` folder to any static host over HTTPS (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages via Actions).
The service worker makes it installable and playable offline. Bump `CACHE` in `www/sw.js` on each release.

## Android build

Requires Android Studio (JDK 21, SDK 36).
```bash
npm install
npm run android:sync     # copies www/ into the app and updates plugins
npm run android:open     # open in Android Studio → Run / Build → Generate Signed Bundle
```
App id: `com.amsolutions.egyptquest` (change in `capacitor.config.json` before the first Play upload).
Regenerate icons after editing `resources/`: `npx @capacitor/assets generate --android --assetPath resources`.

## Tests

```bash
npm test             # unit tests of the progression rules (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies)
npm run test:e2e     # browser tests of the progression flows (needs: pip install playwright && playwright install chromium)
```

## Changelog — v4.3.1

- El Gouna Film Festival is now about **Egyptian films from 2015 on**: live Wikidata questions only use films released from 2015 (and the actors in them), and the built-in bank was replaced with post-2015 films — stars, directors, release years, plots and new film jokes (title riddles). Set `MIN_YEAR` in `games/el-gouna.js` to change the cut-off.

## Changelog — v4.3 (progression)

**Ankh tokens** (☥) — a separate counter from points; points stay the shop currency.
- A win pays Ankh = **new best stars − old best stars** on that level (levels 1–5). Replays only pay improvements, so the same stars are never paid twice. Endless and bonus games give no Ankh.
- **Levels**: level 1 is free; level 2/3/4/5 cost 1/2/3/3 Ankh and need the previous level completed. Tap *Unlock* in the level list, or *Unlock & play* in the result dialog. Endless opens free once level 5 is completed.
- **Places**: a place opens when the previous place has **levels 1–3 completed and 6★** (best per level, summed). Configurable in `config.js → PROGRESSION` or per place with `unlock:{levels,stars}`. Opened places never re-lock. Finishing El Gouna the same way completes the journey (new achievement).
- **Scribe's Trials** — a no-ads, no-purchase way forward using the existing bonus games (same targets, no points):
  - *Token Trial*: +1 Ankh when a level is blocked only by Ankh (max 2 per place).
  - *Passage Trial*: after 3 losses in a row on a level, pass it at 0★ (max 1 per place).
- Every way to start a level goes through one guard (`startSite`), so locked levels/places cannot be started from deep links or old buttons.
- UI: Ankh balance and progress in the level list and info card; progress ring on the next locked place; a short reveal animation when a place opens (skipped on tap and with *reduce motion*).

**Saves**: new fields `pv:2, tok, tokEarned, ul{sites,levels}, cleared, trial, fails`. A save without `pv` is migrated once: everything that was open stays open (places and levels), and Ankh = sum of your best stars. Values are validated on load. Backup codes are now `v:2`; old `v:1` codes still restore (and are migrated).

## Changelog — v4.2.1

- Siwa Oasis sliding puzzle: **Hint** button. A hint plans a solution from the current board (A* search; fallback = undoing the shuffle) and highlights the next 3 tiles to slide with an arrow. Uses the shared hint stock (rewarded ad when empty); more than one hint caps the result at ★★.

## Changelog — v4.2 (map redesign)

- Illustrated, code-painted Egypt map (`map-art.js`) with shaded relief, realistic Nile course (Lake Nasser → Qena bend → Delta branches), Delta & valley vegetation, oases, seas with depth, fading neighbouring lands, gold coastline and graticule; works in all three map themes.
- Map centred below the top HUD; governorate labels fade in by zoom (small Delta governorates only when zoomed); fixed spiky label outlines.
- Emoji removed from the map and HUD: vector glyphs on the canvas (daily star, star counts, curse/ward feedback, compass rose) and SVG/CSS-mask icons in the HUD (`assets/icons/ui-*.svg`, `setRich()` in `ui.js`). Bonus/Book/Shop now have their own icons.
- Fixes: hearts disappeared and quiz score lost its ✓/✗ (stripped by the emoji filter) → text hearts ♥/♡ and ✓/✗; mute button was blank on first launch; score pill overflowed on phones; emoji filter missed ⭐ ⚡ ⏱ ⬜ ☠ ♾ ⚠.

## Changelog — v4.1

**Progression (harder, more replay)**: a place unlocks only after **★★★ on the previous place** (any level); points are for the shop. *(Replaced in v4.3.)*
★★★ requires a run with no lost hearts. Replaying an already-starred level pays 25% (was 40%).

**Win or lose**: every place run has **❤❤❤** (❤❤ on level 5+, Marsa Matruh has 5). Each mistake costs a heart; at 0 the level is lost
(no points). Puzzles without mistakes have move limits (Siwa, Edfu, Philae); Luxor allows N free mismatches; Kharga costs a heart
for a full-but-wrong grid; Giza hunt costs a heart every 3 misses. One "watch an ad → +1 ❤ and continue" per run.
Bonus games need a target: Scarab Rush 30, Treasure Catch 40, Pharaoh Quiz 3/5.

**Fresh questions, never repeated** (`www/js/core/qgen.js`, no API keys):
- Pharaoh Quiz: Wikidata (pharaoh photos, monuments → governorate, governorate capitals, Arabic + English) + Open Trivia DB (English, session token).
- El Gouna: Wikidata Egyptian cinema with photos — *who is this star?*, *which film did X appear in?*, director, release year — mixed with the hand-written bank.
- Shown questions are remembered in `localStorage` (`egyptquest.seen`); data is cached 3 days; offline falls back to the built-in banks.
- Easy levels use well-known stars/films (by Wikipedia popularity); photo distractors match gender; photos with printed names are skipped.

To add your own place's questions or tune difficulty, see `QGen` in `qgen.js`.

## Changelog — v4.0

**Structure**: monolithic engine split into modules; one self-registering file per place; bonus games in `games/bonus/`;
entry renamed to `index.html`; images renamed to clean slugs and resized (737 KB → ~230 KB); removed iframe wrapper pages
(use `?game=` deep links); removed unused world layouts for Alexandria/Luxor/Philae/Abu Simbel (those sites use mini-games).

**Fixes**
- Duplicate code left by the previous split (shared helpers were buried in random game files).
- In-game title pill wrapped to two lines and covered each game's header; now one line (level & points first).
- Mascot quips/toasts covered game content (e.g. El Gouna questions) — moved to the bottom while playing.
- El Gouna question category hidden under the status pill — layout moved down.
- GEM: title under the HUD and subtitle hidden by a dark band; "Book tickets" link never appeared (CSS hid it) — now a button in the GEM info card; board could deadlock when the computer filled the last cell; stale AI move could land in a new game; lose effect relied on matching status text.
- Delayed callbacks (El Gouna, Red Sea, Pharaoh Quiz…) could award a win after leaving the game or into another game — new run-scoped `later()`.
- `?game=` deep links skipped the unlock requirement.
- Map logos: broken images drew an empty marker (now falls back to the icon).
- Daily-login reward popup was lost if another dialog replaced it — re-shown when returning to the map.
- Save on app background / page hide; audio suspended in background.

**Improvements**: GEM AI scales with level (blocks/wins from level 2, smarter from level 3); Android back button
(closes dialogs → leaves game → minimizes); Escape key on desktop; PWA manifest + offline service worker; app icons & splash.
